# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/) in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) :heart:

My goals for AoC2019:

- Complete every day
- Exercise and improve my Elixir skills
- Publish readable code

I will not optimize for speed, or for lines of code.


## Run the tests

Check out the project, fetch the dependencies and run the tests:

```
mix deps.get
mix test
```
